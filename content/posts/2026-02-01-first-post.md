# Why building a blog

I have been thinking about creating something to explain what I study daily,
I tried some pages that let you do it directly on them but didn't feel good
at all and for some time I just parked it and never thought about it again.

But yesterday while studying about algorithms of parsers I got inspired again
when I read a blog post from [matklad](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html), I already knew him from tigerbeetle but never
saw his blog, but when I saw it, it felt like that is what I always wanted
to do.

So today I just made a simple blog using TypeScript and just parsing markdown
into HTML to render the posts, it's very simple but it's just what I need,
right now it's using marked, highlight and marked-highlight as dependencies
but it could be nice to make a parser from md to HTML, serve the blog on localhost
automatically, add a header with information and some more features but right now
it's perfect for my needs at the moment.

So well the intention is to write here about what I study or do while programming
and use it as a diary to keep track of what I do for myself and maybe if at some
time I write something interesting, for anyone that would like to read it.
